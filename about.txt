Fun facts about myself:

I played only once in front of a crowd and it was in one of the biggest Techno club in the world but then... I have stopped playing music.

I got my Reiki certification level 2 in Bali this year.

Before dying I would love to:
- Speak 4 languages fluently: French, English ok - Working on my German and later on Spanish
- Get a digital nomad lifestyle between Berlin and Bali and South America
- Keep playing music but not in Berlin, where I no longer find myself inspired
and many more but then this is  getting too confidential
